**What is DAABBCC?**

A Dynamic AABB Tree is a binary search algorithm for fast overlap testing. Dynamic AABB trees are good for general purpose use, and can handle moving objects very well. The data structure provides an efficient way of detecting potential overlap between objects.   
DAABBCC is not a physics engine. DAABBCC does not contain narrow-phase collision detection and manifold generation.

It is very well suited for platformers, bullet-hell, top down games which doesnt require narrow-phase collision detection.
