This is a Dynamic Tree(aka AABB Tree) native extension for [Defold Engine](https://www.defold.com/).    
DAABBCC build by using Box2Dâ€™s [Dynamic Tree](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d/blob/main/src/dynamic_tree.c).

**What is DAABBCC?**

A Dynamic AABB Tree is a binary search algorithm for fast overlap testing. Dynamic AABB trees are well-suited for general-purpose use and can handle moving objects efficiently. This data structure provides an effective method for detecting potential overlap between objects.  

DAABBCC is not a physics engine. It does not include narrow-phase collision detection or manifold generation.  

It is particularly well-suited for platformers, bullet-hell, and top-down games that do not require narrow-phase collision detection.
