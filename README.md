This is a [Dynamic AABB Tree](https://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_DynamicBVH_Full.pdf) native extension for [Defold Engine](https://www.defold.com/).    
DAABBCC build by using Box2Dâ€™s [Dynamic Tree](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d/blob/main/src/dynamic_tree.c).

**What is DAABBCC?**

A Dynamic AABB Tree is a binary search algorithm for fast overlap testing. Dynamic AABB trees are good for general purpose use, and can handle moving objects very well. The data structure provides an efficient way of detecting potential overlap between objects.   
DAABBCC is not a physics engine. DAABBCC does not contain narrow-phase collision detection and manifold generation.

It is very well suited for platformers, bullet-hell, top down games which doesnt require narrow-phase collision detection.


## Installation

You can use the A* extension in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies).  
Open your `game.project` file, select  `Project ` and add a  `Dependencies ` field:

>https://github.com/selimanac/defold-astar/archive/master.zip <- TODO 3.0

or you can add stable versions from [releases](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-daabbcc/releases).
